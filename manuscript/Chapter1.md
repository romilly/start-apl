# Chapter 1

One reason to love APL is that you can try things out as you learn them, and that's a great way to learn.

To follow these examples you'll need to start an APL session or log on to the tryap[l.org website.

Once you've done that, you can type the code you'll see below.

In the examples that follow, code that you type is indented by six spaces. Once you start trying APL,
you'll see that APL inserts those spaces for you when it's ready for you to type.

So - here goes. Type

So far, so good. As you can see, the APL environment includes a [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) - a Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop.

That means that you can write code and try it out right away. As mentioned above, that's a great way to lern a lanugage,
and it's also a great way to develop software.

Plus and minus are __primitive functions__ in APL. What about multiply and divide?


APL has functions

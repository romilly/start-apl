# Learn APL - book extract

This is an extract from a new Introductory book on APL. It features
Dyalog's free implementation on the Raspberry Pi, but you can also use
it if you are learning Dyalog APL on Windows, OS/X or other Linux systems.

I hope it will motivate you to take a look at this powerful language and
help you to get started.

The book is ideal if you are entering the Dyalog annual problem-solving
competition.

An early access version of the book is [available on Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/learnapl).

It's about 40% complete at the moment and if you buy it now you will
get free access to future updates.

The book should be complete by the end of April 2017.

All Leanpub purchases offer an unconditional 45-day money-back guarantee.

There's a slower-paced, more detailed, and much longer textbook called
*Mastering Dyalog APL* by Bernard Legrand.

It's is written for Dyalog for Microsoft Windows, but the language elements
(which form most of the content) apply to all platforms.

You can [download a free PDF](http://www.dyalog.com/uploads/documents/MasteringDyalogAPL.pdf)
of Bernard's book or buy a
[print-on-demand version on Amazon](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Mastering-Dyalog-APL-Complete-Introduction/dp/0956463800/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1387290291&sr=8-1&keywords=mastering+dyalog)

## Another approach

You can also learn APL by experiment!

Just hover your mouse over a symbol on the RIDE.
The RIDE will tell you the symbol's name and its purpose,
and give simple examples of its use.
 
Try executing the examples and then try different data. You'll soon discover
a lot about APL's capabilities.

Don't worry while you're experimenting. If you make a mistake you won't break
anything :)

The next chapter will give you a first taste of the language and its
development environment.

Have fun!

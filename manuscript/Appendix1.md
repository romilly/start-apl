## Installing APL on the Raspberry Pi

You can download and install a copy of APL for the Raspberry Pi from Dyalog.
It's free for personal use. If you want to use it for work,
or create a product that you or others sell,
you will need to get a commercial license.

You can install and run Dyalog APL on the following Raspberry Pi versions:

    Pi 1 Model A
    Pi 1 Model A+
    Pi 1 Model B
    Pi 1 Model B+
    Pi 2 Model B
    Pi 3 Model B
    Pi zero (all versions)
    
The current version (15.0) of Dyalog APL will run on the wheezy and
jessie versions of Raspbian.

Once installed, Dyalog requires 100 MB of storage. You will need another
100 MB temporarily for the installation image.

You can find installation instructions [here](http://packages.dyalog.com/).

## Installing APL on the Raspberry Pi

You can download and install a copy of APL for the Raspberry Pi from Dyalog.
It's free for personal use. If you want to use it for work,
or create a product that you or others sell,
you will need to get a commercial license.

You can install and run Dyalog APL on the following Raspberry Pi versions:

    Pi 1 Model A
    Pi 1 Model A+
    Pi 1 Model B
    Pi 1 Model B+
    Pi 2 Model B
    Pi 3 Model B
    Pi zero (all versions)
    
The current version (15.0) of Dyalog APL runs on the *jessie* version of Raspbian.

You can find installation instructions [here](http://packages.dyalog.com/).
